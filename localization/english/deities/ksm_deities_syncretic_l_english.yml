 omen_anat_bastet_desc:0 "Anat-Bastet is a syncretic deity that represents a combination of the ferocious warrior goddess Anat and the gentle feline goddess Bastet. As a result, she is both a protector and a destroyer, embodying the duality of life and death.\n\nAnat-Bastet is depicted as a beautiful woman with the head of a cat, wielding a sword in one hand and a sacred instrument called a sistrum in the other. She is associated with music, dance, and fertility, as well as with warfare and hunting. Her worship was particularly popular among women, who sought her protection during childbirth and prayed to her for good health and prosperity.\n\nIn some legends, Anat-Bastet is said to have been born from the union of the god of the sky and the goddess of the sun. She is often depicted as a companion and ally of other major deities, such as Ra, Horus, and Osiris. Despite her seemingly contradictory nature, Anat-Bastet was widely revered throughout ancient Egypt, and her cult endured for centuries."
