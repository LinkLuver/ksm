The combination of these two deities represented a union of strength, protection, and the power of the sun. Sobek-Ra was often depicted as a man with the head of a crocodile wearing the sun disk and cobra on his head, with a crocodile tail. He was believed to be the protector of pharaohs and the Nile, and was worshipped for his strength and power. In addition to being a god of protection, Sobek-Ra was also associated with creation and rebirth, as well as with the cycles of the sun."
