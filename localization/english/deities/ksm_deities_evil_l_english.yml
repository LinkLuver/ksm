She was depicted with the head of a crocodile, the front legs of a lion or leopard, and the hindquarters of a hippopotamus. Ammit was the goddess of punishment and was believed to devour the hearts of the wicked in the afterlife. The ancient Egyptians believed that after death, the heart of the deceased would be weighed against the feather of Ma'at, the goddess of truth and justice. If the heart was found to be heavy with sin, it would be fed to Ammit, preventing the soul from entering the afterlife. Her fearsome appearance served as a warning to the living to lead a moral and just life."
